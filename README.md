# Project Description

MyPaws is my first Android application project done as part of the Mobile Application Development module offered by Taylor's University. It was done as a requirement for completion of the module and served as a learning project for me allowing me to familiarize myself with Android Studio and Android development. 
MyPaws is mostly a static application as most of its data were hardcoded into the application by me.

MyPaws uses Google's Firebase and Firebase cloud database services for its user authentication and data storage.

# Compatability

MyPaws needs minimum Android SDK API level 26 to run
